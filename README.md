# Explainable Probabilistic Forecasting of Conflict-Related Fatalities

Can we predict wars? How certain would we be in our predictions?
This research presents the first publicly available and explainable
early conflict forecasting model capable of forecasting distribution
of conflict-related fatalities on a country-month level. The model seeks
to be maximally transparent, uses publicly available data and produces
predictions up to 14 months into the future. Our model improves over
3 out of 4 benchmark years but misses the violence spikes, possibly, due
to the nature of independent variables in the dataset. The presented
model can complement the field of conflict-warning systems and serve as
a reference against which future improvements can be evaluated.
